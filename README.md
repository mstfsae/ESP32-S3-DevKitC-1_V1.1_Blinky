# ESP32-S3-DevKitC-1 V1.1 Blink Code
Not to be confused with `ESP32-S3-DevKitC-1 V1.0` blink code.  
The `V1.0` LED GPIO is `GPIO48`   
The `V1.1` LED GPIO is `GPIO38`  

This should be the code we use to get people started with ESP-IDF implementation with PlatformIO and the `ESP32-S3-DevKitC-1 V1.1` board.
